## 1. 🏗️ Multiplayer Architecture

| Class | Responsibility | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| **AGameModeBase / AGameMode** | Defines game rules and win/loss conditions (server-only) | Only exists on the server |
| **AGameStateBase / AGameState** | Tracks match state, time, score (server + replicated to all clients) | Syncs global data to clients |
| **APlayerController** | Represents the player's input and client control logic | First class a player "owns" |
| **APlayerState** | Holds player-related data (name, score, team, etc.) | Exists on server and all clients |
| **APawn / ACharacter** | The controllable actor (body) in the world | Possessed by PlayerController |
| **AHUD** | Basic on-screen UI manager (legacy) | Generally replaced by UMG in modern projects |
| **UUserWidget** | UI elements created via Unreal Motion Graphics (UMG) | For health bars, ammo, HUDs, menus |

## 5. 🖼️ User Interface (HUD)

</div>

### 🧭 Compass System
For the compass HUD, we use a texture that loops and rolls over to create the compass effect. The position & offset on the texture is changed through the controller class.

<div align="center">

![Compass System](IMAGE_URL_HERE)

</div>

### 🗺️ MiniMap System
We implemented two modes:

1. **Camera Mode (Active)** - Camera held above the player's head, output passed through color grading filter (rendered at low resolution for performance)
2. **Texture Mode** - Track character location and map it onto premade level texture

### 📢 MessageBox System
The `showMessageBox()` function can be called through the `PlayerController`.

### 📊 Status Displays
- **Weapon/Health/Ammo/Grenade** - Values stored within the pawn, HUD updates on value changes
- **ClipAmmo & InventoryAmmo** - Changes based on currently equipped weapon

### 🎯 HitMarker System
When players land successful hits, red hitmarkers appear to provide visual feedback.

## 6. 🔊 Audio System

### 🌍 Ambient Audio Objects
Special actors that trigger when players enter a certain radius, responsible for playing background ambient noise.
> Location: `Content/SoundAmbience/Apocalypse`

### 🎧 Spatial Audio Attenuation System

#### **Core Features:**
- Distance-based volume attenuation (linear/logarithmic curves)
- Configurable min/max distance thresholds (400-4000 units)
- Real-time 3D position tracking

#### **Reverb Processing:**
- Send-based reverb with wet/dry control (0.3-0.95 mix)
- Distance-dependent reverb send levels
- Linear reverb method implementation

#### **Spatial Audio:**
- Binaural HRTF spatialization
- 3D stereo spread (200 units)
- Omni-directional sound placement
- Radius-based spatial falloff (500 units)

#### **Advanced Systems:**
- Environmental occlusion filtering
- Air absorption (frequency-dependent attenuation)
- Dynamic listener focus with azimuth scaling
- Priority-based audio culling

#### **Technical Implementation:**
- Plugin-based audio processing
- Real-time parameter interpolation
- Performance-optimized for multi-source environments
- Configurable falloff curves and attenuation shapes

### Audio Processing Pipeline

    W -->|No| Y[Standard Processing]
    
    X --> Z[Final Audio Output]
    Y --> Z
    E --> AA[Remove from Pipeline]
```

### 🦶 Dynamic Audio Effects
**Footsteps, Roars, Growls, Screams** and other audio effects are mostly baked into the animations themselves.

> **Note:** For gun-impact/hit sounds, we check material tags to play different sounds. We also have a mechanism for footsteps that changes sounds according to ground type, but it's currently disabled due to lack of quality walking sound assets.

## 7. 🎯 Prop Hunt Game Mode

A fun multiplayer game mode where one player is randomly selected as a prop who must hide from the other players (hunters) within a time limit.

### 🎭 Prop Player Abilities

#### 1. 🔄 Transformation System
Ability to transform into any model the prop player is contacting.

<div align="center">
